### Spam Mail Classification using NLP and ML

## Project Description
# Spam emails disrupt communication and pose security risks. This project implements a spam email classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to identify spam and non-spam (ham) emails. The solution is deployed as a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time email classification.
